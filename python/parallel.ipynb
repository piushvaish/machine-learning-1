    "The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is one of the most controversial subjects in the Python world. In CPython, the most popular implementation of Python, the GIL is a [mutex (mutually exclusive object)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34524/what-is-a-mutex) that makes things thread-safe. The GIL makes it easy to integrate with external libraries that are not thread-safe, and it makes non-parallel code faster. This comes at a cost, though. Due to the GIL, we can't achieve true parallelism via multithreading. Basically, two different native threads of the same process can't run Python code at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things are not that bad, though, and here's why: stuff that happens outside the GIL realm is free to be parallel. In this category fall long-running tasks like I/O and libraries like Numpy (Numpy works around this limitation by running external code in C)."

    "From the last section, we learned that unlike other programming language, Python is not truly multithreaded as it can't run multiple threads simultaneously on multiple cores/CPUs due to the GIL. Before we move on, let's take a step back and understand what is a thread, what is a process and the distinction between them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **process** is a program that is in execution. In other words, code that are running (e.g. Jupyter notebook, Google Chrome, Python interpreter). Multiple processes are always running in a computer, and they are executed in parallel.\n",
    "- A **process can spawn multiple threads (sub-processes)** to handle subtasks. They live inside processes and share the same memory space (they can read and write to the same variables). Ideally, they run in parallel, but not necessarily. The reason why processes aren't enough is because applications need to be responsive and listen for user actions while updating the display and saving a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Microsoft Word. When we open up Word, we're essentially creating a process (an instance of the program). When we start typing, the process spawns a number of threads: one to read keystrokes, another to display text on the screen, a thread to autosave our file, and yet another to highlight spelling mistakes. By spawning multiple threads, Microsoft takes advantage of \"wasted CPU time\" (waiting for our keystrokes or waiting for a file to save) to provide a smoother user interface and make us more productive.\n",

This module features the Executor class which is an abstract class and it can not be used directly, however, it has two very useful concrete subclasses – `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`. As their names suggest, one uses multithreading and the other one uses multiprocessing as their backend. In both case, we get a pool of threads or processes and we can submit tasks to this pool. The pool would assign tasks to the available resources (threads or pools) and schedule them to run.\n",

    "From the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor): For multiprocessing, this iterable is broken into chunks and each of these chunks is passed to the function in separate processes. We can control the chunk size by passing a third parameter, chunk_size. By default the chunk size is 1. For very long iterables, using a large value for chunksize can significantly improve performance compared to the default size of 1. With ThreadPoolExecutor, chunksize has no effect."

We pause its execution, letting it wait for the timer to expire, and in this time we spawn the second thread. We repeat this for all the threads. The moment the timer of the first thread expires, we switch execution to it and terminate it. The algorithm is repeated for the second and for all the other threads.
