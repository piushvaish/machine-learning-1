    "At a high level `Word2Vec` is a unsupervised learning algorithm that uses a shallow neural network (with one hidden layer) to learn the vectorial representations of all the unique words/phrases for a given corpus. The advantage that word2vec offers is it tries to preserve the semantic meaning behind those terms. For example, a document may employ the words \"dog\" and \"canine\" to mean the same thing, but never use them together in a sentence. Ideally, the word2vec algorithm would be able to learn the context and place them together in similar vector semantic space.\n",

    "- `min_count`: For pruning the internal dictionary. Words that appear only once or twice in a billion-word corpus are probably uninteresting typos and garbage. In addition, there's not enough data to make any meaningful training on those words, so it's best to ignore them. A reasonable value for min_count is between 0-100, depending on the size of the dataset.\n",
    "- `size`: Refers to the hidden layers size, i.e. dimension of our word vectors. Bigger size values require more training data, but can lead to better (more accurate) models. Reasonable values are in the tens to hundreds\n",
    "- `workers`: Number of cores/threads used for training.\n",
    "- `window`: Only terms that occur within a window-neighbourhood of a term in a sentence are associated with it during training. The default value is 4. Unless your text contains big sentences, it might be safe to leave it at that.\n",
    "- `sg`: This defines the algorithm. If equal to 1, the skip-gram technique is used. Else, the CBoW method is employed. The word2vec framework we introduced here is skip-gram, where we're using the target word to predict the context word, where CBow is simply flipping it the other way around, i.e. using the context word to predict the target word. Based on the original author's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546), Skip-gram is reported to be a better framework.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A direct application of Word2Vec to a classical engineering task was recently presented by Spotify. They abstracted the ideas behind Word2Vec to apply them not simply to words in sentences but to any object in any sequence, in this case to songs in a playlist. Songs are treated as words and other songs in a playlist as their surrounding context, depending on whether the playlists in question were genre specific the vocabulary encompassed a number of songs from that collection. Now in order to recommend songs to a user one merely has to examine a neighborhood of the 'song embeddings' of songs the user already likes\n",
    "- Similarly, we could recommend a user who to connect to in a social network setting by examining the graph of relationships, where the nodes represent words and a path through the graph represents a sentence, then nodes that occur in the context of similar other nodes, would be close together in the vector space.\n",
